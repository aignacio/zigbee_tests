   * smpl_config.dat file. After the link token is set the Join context must
   * be enabled.
   *
   * NOTE that this is done after initialization. For APs the init sequence
   * consists of a step in which a link token is generated. The sequence here
   * overrides that setting. It can be used to distribute different link tokens
   * to different devices. The sequence here is a simple example of how to use
   * the IOCTL interface to set the Link token for subsequent Joiners.
   *
   * You might want to be careful about following this particular example if you
   * are restoring from NV unless you are setting a fixed value as is done here.
   * Unconditionally setting a random value will make it esentially impossible
   * for newly joining devices to link to devices that joined before the AP was
   * reset since they will have different link tokens.
